# clock_app
This is a clock application that gives the user multiple features. 
One of the features is the ability to show the clock in two different view.
A digital view, and an analog view. To access those views, the user will need to
choose which view they want to see and then add the view by clicking the add button.
The user can add as many clock views as they would like. 

# App Design 
the app has one main screen, the main screen has two buttons. The first
button to add an analog clock and the second one to add a digital one. Every 
time the user adds a new clock, it will show up one the screen. Every clock will 
be number to show which one was created first.
